# Third party notices

certdoctor is Copyright (C) 2026 DonislawDev and is licensed under the GNU
General Public License, version 3. The full text is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Every certdoctor binary also contains code that other people wrote: the Go
runtime and standard library, and five modules, all of them brought in by the
JavaScript engine that evaluates a proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file. Their
licences ask that their notices travel with every copy, a binary one included,
so this file is part of every release archive and is compiled into the program
itself - `certdoctor --license` prints it after the GPL. Each of these licences
is compatible with GPL-3.0.

The same modules are in all five builds: Windows and Linux on amd64 and arm64,
and macOS on arm64. One notice below belongs to a file of the Go runtime that
only the amd64 builds link, and it says so. What this file lists is
checked rather than asserted. A guard in the source asks the build which
packages it links, for each of the five, and fails when a module is missing
here, when a version here is not the one linked, or when a licence file in the
tree of a linked package is not reproduced in full under its own heading.

`go.mod` names more modules than these. The others are there because a
dependency's own `go.mod` names them for its tests and tools, none of them is
linked, and so none of them is here.

## Go standard library and runtime

Version `go1.27.3`. BSD-3-Clause. Every Go program links the runtime and the
parts of the standard library it uses, so this applies to every build. The text
below is the `LICENSE` file at the root of that Go distribution, and the copies
of `golang.org/x/crypto`, `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/sys` and
`golang.org/x/text` that the standard library carries inside itself are under
the same text.

### Notices inside the standard library

Some files of the standard library are derived from code published under a
notice of its own, and the Go project keeps that notice in the source. These
are the ones in the packages certdoctor links, as the source states them.

#### Sun's fdlibm, by way of FreeBSD, in package `math`

Several functions in `math` are derived from FreeBSD's `msun`, which came from
Sun's fdlibm. The notice appears in two forms.

`ATTRIB`, which names the code ported from other projects and the licences it
came under:

```
============
These pieces of code were ported from dotnet/corefx:

syntax/charclass.go (from RegexCharClass.cs): ported to use the built-in Go unicode classes.  Canonicalize is 
    a direct port, but most of the other code required large changes because the C# implementation 
    used a string to represent the CharSet data structure and I cleaned that up in my implementation.

syntax/code.go (from RegexCode.cs): ported literally with various cleanups and layout to make it more Go-ish.

syntax/escape.go (from RegexParser.cs): ported Escape method and added some optimizations.  Unescape is inspired by 
    the C# implementation but couldn't be directly ported because of the lack of do-while syntax in Go.

syntax/parser.go (from RegexpParser.cs and RegexOptions.cs): ported parser struct and associated methods as 
    literally as possible. Several language differences required changes.  E.g. lack pre/post-fix increments as 
    expressions, lack of do-while loops, lack of overloads, etc.

syntax/prefix.go (from RegexFCD.cs and RegexBoyerMoore.cs): ported as literally as possible and added support
    for unicode chars that are longer than the 16-bit char in C# for the 32-bit rune in Go.

syntax/replacerdata.go (from RegexReplacement.cs): conceptually ported and re-organized to handle differences 
    in charclass implementation, and fix odd code layout between RegexParser.cs, Regex.cs, and RegexReplacement.cs.

syntax/tree.go (from RegexTree.cs and RegexNode.cs): ported literally as possible.

syntax/writer.go (from RegexWriter.cs): ported literally with minor changes to make it more Go-ish.

match.go (from RegexMatch.cs): ported, simplified, and changed to handle Go's lack of inheritence.

regexp.go (from Regex.cs and RegexOptions.cs): conceptually serves the same "starting point", but is simplified 
    and changed to handle differences in C# strings and Go strings/runes.  

replace.go (from RegexReplacement.cs): ported closely and then cleaned up to combine the MatchEvaluator and 
    simple string replace implementations.

runner.go (from RegexRunner.cs): ported literally as possible.

regexp_test.go (from CaptureTests.cs and GroupNamesAndNumbers.cs): conceptually ported, but the code was 
    manually structured like Go tests.

replace_test.go (from RegexReplaceStringTest0.cs): conceptually ported

rtl_test.go (from RightToLeft.cs): conceptually ported

============
These pieces of code are copied from the Go framework:

- The overall directory structure of regexp2 was inspired by the Go runtime regexp package.
- The optimization in the escape method of syntax/escape.go is from the Go runtime QuoteMeta() func in regexp/regexp.go
- The method signatures in regexp.go are designed to match the Go framework regexp methods closely
- func regexp2.MustCompile and func quote are almost identifical to the regexp package versions
- BenchmarkMatch* and TestProgramTooLong* funcs in regexp_performance_test.go were copied from the framework 
    regexp/exec_test.go

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
